Basically this forms a neat way for me to view the progress of my ideas so I tend to use it for homeworks. We can switch to scripts if you prefer that instead as well. Also, I've imported the 'numpy' package into python. The syntax of using that is close to Matlab so I thought it would make things more comfortable for you. \n",
